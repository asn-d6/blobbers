## Blobber

blobber packs arbitrary data into [proto-danksharded transactions](https://www.eip4844.com/) and submits them to geth using the JSON-RPC API.

Currently the code can only pack data into blobs. Next step is [to submit that data to geth](https://github.com/asn-d6/blobber/blob/main/blobber.py) using JSON-RPC.

Under active development.
